A `Card` is rendered by an `Event`, and is a container of `Atoms`.

Events have a default `Card`, but you can provide your own by passing a `card` prop to an `Event`.

You'll rarely work with this component directly, unless you're defining your own base `Event` component.

#### Props

- `date` (string): The date of the event. Can be in any format (`10/03/19`, `October 3rd, 2019`, etc.)

- `children` (any): The contents of the event. You can use existing [atoms](/docs/atoms), or define your own contents.
