Atoms are the building blocks used to create events. For example, the `ImageAtom` component renders a responsive image and is used by `ImageEvent`. `TextAtom` renders text (including Markdown) and is used by all of the [higher-level](events#higher-level-events) events.

Atoms are useful when you want to create new higher-level event types, especially if you want to share UI elements or functionality between event types.
