# Theming

You can control the look and feel of almost every component in `React Timeline` via theming. 

## Via the Theme Object
`Timeline` accepts a `theme` prop, which is an object that defines the styles of the timeline and everything within it. Components have default styles that can be overwritten by this object. 

React Timeline includes a few themes that can be imported from the `themes` object. You can pass these  objects to `Timeline` (the `default` theme is used by default) or you can extend them to create custom themes.

Check out the example below in which we customize some of the elements.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Timeline, Events, TextEvent, themes, createTheme } from '@merc/react-timeline';

const customTheme = createTheme(themes.default, {
  card: {
    backgroundColor: '#efefef',
  },
  date: {
    backgroundColor: 'rebeccapurple',
  },
  marker: {
    borderColor: 'rebeccapurple',
  },
  timelineTrack: {
    backgroundColor: 'rebeccapurple',
  },
});

export default function() {
  return (
    <Timeline theme={customTheme}>
      <Events>
        <TextEvent date="10/01/19" text="The lines are now purple..." />
        <TextEvent
          date="10/02/19"
          text="... and the cards have a grey background!"
        />
      </Events>
    </Timeline>
  );
}
```

<CustomThemeDemo />

## Via Regular CSS
Even though this library uses [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/), each component also uses a semantic class name that you can use when writing stylesheets.

## Which Method Should I Use?
I think using a `theme` object is easier, but it only gets you 90% of the way there. Using a custom stylesheet gives you full control over everything, but may not be as intuitive. Luckily, the two options aren't mutually exclusive; you can use a `theme` object for the majority of your styling, and then use a stylesheet to cover any edge cases.
