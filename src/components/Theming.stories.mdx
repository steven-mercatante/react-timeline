# Theming

You can control the look and feel of almost every component in `React Timeline` via theming. 

## Via Regular CSS
Even though this library uses [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/), each component also uses a semantic class name that you can use when writing stylesheets.

## Via the Theme Object
`Timeline` accepts a `theme` prop, which takes an `object` that defines the styles of the timeline and everything within it. Components have default styles that can be overwritten by this object. For example, the below `theme` would make the timeline's track (the vertical line on which events are placed) red:

```jsx
const theme = {
  timelineTrack: {
    backgroundColor: 'red'
  }
}

<Timeline theme={theme}>
  <Events>
    ...
  </Events>
</Timeline>
```

### Creating a Theme
Each component exposes a unique key that you can use to overwrite its style. In the above example, the timeline track uses `timelineTrack` as its key.

Below is a list of all the supported keys:

| Component | Description | Theme Key |
| --------- | ----------- | --------- |
| `Timeline` | The root timeline | `timeline` |
| `Timeline` track | The vertical line that events are attached to | `timelineTrack` |
