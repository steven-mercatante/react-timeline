# Events

Events are the lifeblood of a timeline. They represent anything from when you were born, to the first moon landing, to a conference talk you delivered, or literally anything else that occurred at some point in time.

Events are usually displayed in chronological order, either ascending or descending, but you can order them however you like.

## Anatomy of an Event

An event is composed of a few pieces:

- its outer container, responsible for its positioning and flexbox layout. This container uses `display: flex` and contains three columns:
  - `DateColumn` renders the event's date. It usually expects a string (e.g `10/03/19`), but can also be passed a custom `EventDate` instance.
  - `MarkerColumn` renders the event's marker (the dot or other shape on the vertical timeline). You can pass a custom `EventMarker` to events.
  - `CardColumn` renders the event's `card`. A card is responsible for rendering one or more atoms, which make up the contents of an event.

Here's what an event's structure looks like in code. Note that this is a reduced example.

```jsx
<Container>
  <DateColumn>{DateComponent}</DateColumn>

  <MarkerColumn>{MarkerComponent}</MarkerColumn>

  <CardColumn>{CardComponent}</CardColumn>
</Container>
```

## The Base Event

The base `Event` component is the foundational building block of higher-level events. You can render these directly, but it's often easier to compose a higher-level event.

## Higher-level Events

React Timeline provides numerous higher-level event types. These include:

- `TextEvent` for simply displaying text
- `ImageEvent` for displaying images
- `YouTubeEvent` for embedding YouTube videos (great for when you want to highlight a talk you gave!)

## The Events wrapper

All `Event` instances must be children of an `Events` component. A `Timeline` should contain only one child `Events` component.

```jsx
<Timeline>
  <Events>
    <TextEvent
      date="07/20/1969"
      text="Apollo 11 lands on the moon! What a historic event!"
    />
    <TextEvent
      date="10/02/19"
      text="I had pizza for lunch, also very historic!"
    />
  </Events>
</Timeline>
```
