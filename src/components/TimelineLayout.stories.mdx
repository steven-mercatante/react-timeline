# Layouts

React Timeline supports various responsive layouts by way of a the `layout` setting passed via an `opts` object.

The available layouts are:

| Name | Key | Description |
| ---- | --- | ----------- |
| Alternate Events | `alt-evts` | The default layout. Events will alternate to the left and right of the vertical timeline track. |
| Alternate Events, Inline Date | `alt-evts-inline-date` | Similar to `alt-evts`, but the event date is rendered within the event card instead of across from it on the vertical timeline track. |
| Inline Events | `inline-evts` | Renders all events in the same column. |
| Inline Events, Inline Date | `inline-evts-inline-date` | Similar to `inline-evts`, but the event date is rendered within the event card instead of across from it on the vertical timeline track. |

# Example
